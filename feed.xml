First, LeBron James sets the all-time scoring mark in the NBA, breaking Kareem Abdul Jabbar’s record of 38,387. But the madness didn’t stop there. Just hours later, Russell Westbrook and D’Angelo were traded for one another in a 3-team deal, and the Knicks made an upgrade on the wing. But to start the show, the boys had to re-record a breaking news segment on the shocking Kevin Durant trade to Phoenix that sent shockwaves across the league. It’s a long show, but sometimes, the NBA just has so much news to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
