<p>This week, Jack and Noah discuss each and every first round series and break down the action of the first two games. Among the topics include a breakdown on the wild game 2s in New York and Denver that went down to the wire and ended in heartbreak for Laker and Sixer fans. They also debate where the Suns go from here if they continue losing to Minnesota, and the epic showdown between the Clippers and Mavs.</p>
